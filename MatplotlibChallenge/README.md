I always seem to have issues with GitHub and cloning/pushing my repos so hopefully I did it correctly this time.

Thanks for the help Reza Abasaltian but he went on a tangent about venn diagrams because I said by mistake that they're made of sides rather than circles and he really wanted to use that as a metaphor.

Other than that shout out to ChapGPT and general internet results to help give inspiration. ChapGPT specifically as MVP as they really outshined my expectations.
I really don't understand how to push files to Github. I don't understand how to save the repo correctly so I can simply git push the files/folders to the hub. It is really frustrating because I don't understand the issue.
